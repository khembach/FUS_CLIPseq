Analysis of FUS CLIP-seq data from WT mouse brain homogenate and synaptoneurosome preparations. Each sample consists of two file for the two different smears that we see on the blot: One at 70k where FUS runs and another smear at 115k which we do not know exactly what it would be, maybe another protein complex with FUS.
